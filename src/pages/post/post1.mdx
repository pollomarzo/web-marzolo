<div class="mt-6"></div>

A new project! Self hosted email (with a mail sender service) (thanks dad!), marzolo.com on Cloudflare, so a new website was needed, and here it is. Took me longer than I'd like to admit to figure astro out, but I think it's a solution that might work for us, and for my personal website as well. It's looking really ugly right now... hopefully I'll manage to get it looking alright.

<div class="flex flex-row pt-4">
  <img width="50%" src="/old_layout_posts.png" />
  <img width="50%" src="/old_layout_single.png" />
</div>

It's the afternoon after an exam. The only time I _truly_ feel I'm entitled to do whatever I want. So I'm on my laptop, thinking about my family. I'm not a great writer. I don't feel I have much to say in the first place. But you know who is? All of my siblings! How about asking them if they'd like a place to put their writing in? I'll stretch my web dev deltoids while I'm at it... and here we are ðŸ™‚
\

Let's make it so we won't need tooo much maintenance...

But what about a custom style for each family mamber?? That would be really sick.
