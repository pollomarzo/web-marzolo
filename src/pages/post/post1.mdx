It's the afternoon after an exam. The only time I _truly_ feel I'm entitled to do whatever I want. So I'm on my laptop, thinking about my family. I'm not a great writer. I don't feel I have much to say in the first place. But you know who is? All of my siblings! How about asking them if they'd like a place to put their writing in? I'll stretch my web dev deltoids while I'm at it... and here we are ðŸ™‚
